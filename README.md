## Getting Started

![ZETA_Squared](icons/Logo_small.svg) is divided into several subprojects which provide different functionalities and APIs for different programming languages.

If you want to include this repository as a code project in your project, you might want to checkout the `master` branch.

If you want to use this repository without including the whole code, see the `master` branch and the `Release` folder.

If you want to work on and improve ![JULIA_Squared](icons/Logo_small.svg), checkout the `develop` branch and follow the instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md.

### Sub-Project Description

#### API

The API in a specific programming language.

#### App

An example implementation of the [API](#api) in the API-programming language.

#### CSharp

The C# Implementation of ![JULIA_Squared](icons/Logo_small.svg).

## Building and Testing

Every Programming Language folder contains two projects, that contain a `.sln` file if it is a c# project for example.

The `.sln` files link to the correct locations of all dependencies if you clone this project as is [_You might want to reset the references if you want a different folder structure_].

The `.sln` files also contain a reference to the `UnitTests` folder, that includes written UnitTests for the project.
